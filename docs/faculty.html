Bruce Ashton, Pianist, Composer,</span><span id="u214980-2"> and professor emeritus, recently retired from teaching at Southern Adventist University. He holds degrees in piano performance from Capital University (Columbus, Ohio), American Conservatory of Music (Chicago), and the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati.  His teachers include Rudolph Reuter, Leon Fleisher, and Raymond Dudley. For 42 years Dr. Ashton taught piano, music theory, and music history at the collegiate level. With Southern's fine symphony, he has played many of the standard piano concerti, including Beethoven's Fourth and Rachmaninoff's Third. Dr. Ashton gets involved with chamber music at every opportunity, either as pianist, violist, or coach. Most of his musical compositions and/or arrangements are done for a particular situation, often involving a slightly unusual mix of instruments.</span></p>
